                    <h5>Quality Policy</h5>
                    <p>CEG’s Schools &amp; Colleges are committed to providing intellectual, social, cultural and
                        economic benefits to communities through programs of education, research and scholarship. This
                        commitment is supported by the Quality Management System (QMS) that provides the planning,
                        strategy, reporting and continual improvement processes that will create awareness to all
                        customers, clients and stakeholders.</p>

                    <h5>MISSION</h5>
                    <p>Our mission is to produce highly skilled manpower, visionary leaders and enlightened citizens by
                        imparting high quality education through useful research. We are committed to develop human
                        capital by sharpening creative thinking. Besides creation and diffusion of knowledge, our
                        mission includes promotion of humanism and peace through ethical education. As a part of social
                        component, we endeavour to induce changes for betterment of the society as a whole through
                        educational and public services.</p>

                    <h5>VISION</h5>
                    <p>Our vision is to become one of the leading educational institutions in the country and a centre
                        of excellence in primary, secondary and higher secondary education level in the world. We
                        believe to introduce new programs to improve quality of education and review performances to
                        identify opportunities for continual improvement. We aim to dedicate the highest standards of
                        ethical behaviour, innovation, customer focus and a management-systems perspective which drives
                        continuous improvement in all that we do.</p>

                    <h5>Objectives</h5>
                    <p>The basic needs approach incorporates/ declares “Education” as one of the five basic needs and a
                        realistic, scientific and country oriented development policy is vital for satisfying all basic
                        needs. Previously lots of policies have been taken for achieving the fundamental needs, however
                        the success rate was not at a satisfactory level. One of the biggest causes of this failure is
                        the absence of an effective education policy and its implementation.</p>

                    <p>We believe a progressive, scientific education system will prepare the citizens in a precise way
                        so that they can create employment opportunities for others. They will also step forward to
                        break the concept of “first create employment opportunities then educate people”.

                    </p>
                    <p>Cambrian Education group’s schools and colleges acknowledge the precise area of education and
                        committed to provide world class education. It reflects in our slogans</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Education for global opportunity</li>
                        <li>Education for skill</li>
                        <li>Education for employment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Our intellectual creations will not only serve the people of Bangladesh but also they will enter
                        into the global market with national and international experiences.</p>

                    <p>The Founder &amp; Chairman of CEG’s Schools &amp; Colleges, Ln. M. K. Bashar PMJF is working hard
                        to establish a new dimension in our education sector, which will be a landmark for all other
                        educational institutions and through these approaches Bangladesh will touch the highest peak of
                        success.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Quality Education for All by Inspiring Innovation</h5>
                    <p>Quality education enables a human being to develop all his qualities and skills to achieve his
                        aims as a member of society. It is the best approach to provide all learners with education for
                        inspiring innovation and building up the capabilities that they require to become economically
                        productive, contribute to peaceful and democratic society with the enhancement of individual
                        well-being. It is also considered as the best way to ensure capacity development of teachers and
                        other stakeholders to improve their quality.</p>

                    <p> Since its establishment in 1993, Cambrian Education Group (CEG) run by the BSB Foundation
                        Bangladesh, has been working to develop student’s experiential learning to ensure quality
                        education for all. By providing the necessary resources and structures, needed to inspire the
                        total learning process and enhance the creativity of our teachers and instructional staff, CEG
                        has come across new opportunities and experiences for our students.</p>

                    <p>In the context of Bangladesh, quality education is more essential for developing the foundation
                        required for a highly trained work force. Education is the base for deriving the benefits of the
                        information revolution towards building a ‘Digital Bangladesh’. CEG believes that “Digital
                        Education” includes investment in technology and the creation of original tools to give the
                        students opportunities to meet the challenges of the rapidly changing world. The organization
                        also admits that, the purpose of digital education is to transform the way people find a range
                        of technologies and allow the students to excel in their professional and personal lives. By
                        recognizing the circumstances, CEG has ensured the digital education system from its very
                        beginning in pre-primary, primary, secondary, higher secondary, professional and higher
                        education levels. It also supports teachers in innovating and transforming the areas of digital
                        media in teaching, learning and professional development of teachers - staff and now this group
                        is recognized as the “Pioneer of Digital Education System” in Bangladesh. CEG is also taking an
                        initiative to launch the first and only educational TV channel “CTV” in Bangladesh to ensure
                        that Bangladeshi students should have access to the best possible learning environment.</p>

                    <p> Furthermore, CEG believes that the sharing of all innovative approaches of today’s learning
                        process with other educational institutions at home and abroad is invaluable. We share these
                        approaches not only through different TV channels, but we also arrange seminars, workshops,
                        training sessions, health care campaigns for students, common people and other educational
                        institutions to share those initiatives. We are committed to doing it by keeping the same
                        spirit, regardless of the era, race, sex and institutions.</p>

                    <p>We will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of independence of Bangladesh in 2021.On this great
                        occasion, CEG has undertaken “Education Vision 2021” as a social movement for spreading
                        education, and promises to achieve the objective of celebrating this occasion, an illiteracy
                        free Bangladesh.</p>

                    <p>We firmly believe that it would have never been possible to achieve our goal without the
                        unconditional trust and cooperation from all concerned. We express our gratitude to the
                        scholars, educationists, learners and the people of Bangladesh for their invaluable supports,
                        which have encouraged us to be committed to achieve the vision of 2021.</p>

                    <p> Now it is the best time to work together to achieve our 2021 goal!</p>

                    <p>Again, it is the best time to ensure quality education for all to make a digital and literate
                        Bangladesh by 2021.</p>

                    <h5>Cambrian Education Group Philosophy</h5>
                    <p>Every person has the right and capacity to be involved in learning, achieve their aims and make a
                        significant and positive contribution to their community.</p>

                    <p>The world around us is evolving at a surprising rate and the speed of change is increasing every
                        day. So, we need to prepare the CEG students as skilled future citizens. The way we have
                        previously delivered education is no longer effective. Together, we are changing our way of
                        thinking to a new approach. This new approach of education is expressed in one simple but
                        powerful statement and that is- “Education to Inspire Innovation”. As per this approach:

                    </p>
                    <p>we are focused towards our goal and “students” are our first priority;</p>

                    <p>we want to develop our traditional methods of teaching by incorporating new helpful methods with
                        those;</p>

                    <p>we create opportunities for our students to learn;</p>

                    <p>we invest in our students and enrich their talent to acquire the capabilities to become
                        economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic
                        societies and enhance individual well-being to inspire innovation and excellence;</p>

                    <p>all of our students are provided with a caring, creative, and engaging pedagogy that helps them
                        to achieve their aims; therefore, they will have the capacity to engage themselves in learning
                        throughout their lifetime;</p>

                    <p>we are liable for evaluating our students’ work and progress and providing constructive opinions
                        that enrich their careers and we are dedicated to spread quality education by keeping the same
                        spirit, irrespective of the era, race, sex and institutions.</p>

                    <p>“Education to Inspire Innovation” has generated rich debates and thoughtful insight by
                        highlighting our values, skills, practices and knowledge, which will be helpful in a dynamic way
                        for our next generations in a rapidly changing world.</p>

                    <p>The world is rapidly changing. Jobs are being created based on modern technology that did not
                        even exist several years ago.</p>

                    <p>Now-a-days, we live in a world where anyone can discover the secrets of the arctic or ultimate
                        depth of the ocean at a click of a mouse without even stepping out of the house. Knowledge is
                        not limited to textbooks anymore.</p>

                    <p>We are helping our students to understand newly innovated learning tools and inspiring them to
                        become responsible citizens and engaged thinkers with an ethical spirit.</p>
